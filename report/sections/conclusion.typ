= Conclusion
The computational results indicate that the @GA is only capable of finding good solutions for relatively small @TSP instances. This might be due to poor diversification in the population, which leads to premature convergence. Possible improvements could involve introducing Local Search or heuristic-based methods to enhance the initial population, or incorporating other genetic operators.

Moreover, further tests could be conducted on new instances to better understand the algorithm's performance and identify potential weaknesses.

Finally, both the benchmarking and the parameter tuning phases could be refined by using a larger set of instances, possibly with different characteristics, to better assess the performance of the algorithm.
