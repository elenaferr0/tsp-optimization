= Conclusion
The results of the computational experiments show that the @GA is able to find good solutions for the @TSP exclusively for rather small instances. This might be due to poor diversification in the population, which leads to premature convergence. Possible improvements could include the introduction of Local Search or heuristic based methods to enhance the initially generated population, or to the inclusion of other genetic operators.

Finally, both the benchmarking and the parameter tuning phases could be refined by using a larger set of instances, possibly with different characteristics, to better assess the performance of the algorithm.
